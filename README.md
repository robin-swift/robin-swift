Watercolour and mixed media artist living in the UK. On here, I am interested in low-level geometry and embedded systems programming for artistic applications.

I am a core developer on the Embroidermodder 2 Project's family of software: I am currently (May 2025) experimenting with improving the automated testing and building of all the projects so we can have good live updates of the project status. I am also working out how to improve our documentation and test coverage.

Outside of these main programming projects I'm learning how to program in Z80 and Thumb Assembly for embedded systems and the Gameboy Advance.

If you want me to solve a specific problem for you in exchange for funding then please note I only accept offers for open source solutions and I will require that I be able to publish my own copy of the work.

Peace
